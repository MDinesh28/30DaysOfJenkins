# Deploying a WAR File to Tomcat from Jenkins

## Prerequisites
- Jenkins and Tomcat installed on separate EC2 instances.
- Maven installed on Jenkins server.
- GitHub repository with the Java project ([Example Repo](https://github.com/MDinesh28/jenkins-java-project.git)).
- Tomcat user with `manager-script` role configured in `tomcat-users.xml`.

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a complete CI/CD pipeline for deploying a Java web application to an Apache Tomcat server using Jenkins. The setup separates the Jenkins CI server and the Tomcat deployment server into distinct EC2 instances to ensure scalability and security.

### Key Features
- **Automated Build**: The project is built using Maven, ensuring dependency management and reproducibility.
- **Seamless Deployment**: The WAR file is deployed to Tomcat using the Manager API, allowing for quick and efficient application updates.
- **Version Control**: Source code is maintained in GitHub, enabling collaboration and version tracking.
- **Scalability**: By isolating Jenkins and Tomcat on separate servers, the setup supports scaling individual components as needed.

## How It Works
1. **Source Code Management**: The Java project source code is hosted in a GitHub repository.
2. **Continuous Integration**: Jenkins automates the build process using Maven.
3. **Continuous Deployment**: The built WAR file is deployed to the Tomcat server via the Manager API.
4. **Access Application**: Users can access the deployed application through the public IP of the Tomcat server.

## Deployment URL
- Access the deployed application at: `http://<TOMCAT_EC2_PUBLIC_IP>:8080/your-app`

## Troubleshooting
- Verify Tomcat Manager credentials and security group rules.
- Ensure Maven build succeeds without errors.
- Check logs in Jenkins and Tomcat for deployment issues.
