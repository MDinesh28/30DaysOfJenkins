# 🚀 30 Days of Jenkins & AWS DevOps 🚀  

Welcome to my **#30DaysOfJenkins** challenge! This repository documents my journey to master **Jenkins CI/CD pipelines** and **AWS DevOps** by completing **60 hands-on projects** over 30 days.  

---

## **📅 Daily Plan**  
Each day includes:  
✅ **1 AWS Project**: Build real-world AWS infrastructure.  
✅ **1 Jenkins-Centric Project**: Automate CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins.  

---

## **🛠️ Tools Covered**  
- **Jenkins**: Pipelines, plugins, integrations, and troubleshooting.  
- **AWS**: S3, EC2, Lambda, EKS, VPC, IAM, CloudFormation, and more.  
- **DevOps Tools**: Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Ansible, SonarQube, Nexus, Grafana, Prometheus, K8sGPT, Kubecost.  

---

## **📂 Project Structure**  
Each day has its own folder with:  
- **AWS Project**: Code and documentation for the AWS task.  
- **Jenkins Project**: Jenkins pipelines, scripts, and configurations.

| **1**   | Deploy a static website to S3 + CloudFront. | Create a Jenkins freestyle job to clone a GitHub repo and run a shell script. | S3, CloudFront, Jenkins, GitHub. |  
| **2**   | Launch an EC2 instance with a Tomcat server. | Write a Jenkins pipeline to deploy a WAR file to Tomcat on EC2. | EC2, Tomcat, Jenkins, SSH. |  
| **3**   | Set up a private Docker registry in ECR. | Build a Docker image and push to ECR using Jenkins. | ECR, Docker, Jenkins. |  
| **4**   | Deploy a Lambda function via AWS CLI. | Add a Jenkins stage to scan Lambda code with SonarQube. | Lambda, SonarQube, Jenkins. |  
| **5**   | Create a VPC using Terraform. | Use Jenkins to run `terraform apply` and provision AWS infra. | Terraform, VPC, Jenkins. |  
| **...** | ... | ... | ... |  
| **30**  | Deploy a GitOps pipeline with FluxCD on EKS. | Use Jenkins to sync FluxCD and audit changes with K8sGPT. | FluxCD, K8sGPT, Jenkins, EKS. |

## **🌟 Key Skills Gained**  
- **Jenkins Mastery**: Declarative pipelines, plugins, security, and integrations.  
- **AWS Expertise**: Infrastructure-as-code, serverless, Kubernetes, and monitoring.  
- **DevOps Best Practices**: CI/CD, GitOps, compliance-as-code, and disaster recovery.
